<h4>Black Mirror</h4><div class="container"><img src="../images/blackmirror.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></div>
<p>This has to be the most talked-about show Netflix has ever produced. Unlike the other shows mentioned, this show does not follow one character. It is an anthology series. Every episode has its own story unrelated to the next. The common link between all the episodes is technology. Every episode in Black Mirror deals with lives influenced by technology. The stories are so unique and creative that you have to constantly fight the urge to binge-watch the whole series. Some of these stories are so gut-wrenching and shocking that you may question your own reality.</p>
<p>Once again, this article does not intend to say these are the only important shows. It means that these must be watched immediately. If you haven’t watched these shows, then maybe it’s time you get started. If you have watched all six stay tuned for a new list of shows!</p>
